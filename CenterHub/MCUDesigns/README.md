# Modular Chassis Unit (MCU) Designs
This folder constains two seperae designs based on the MCU idea.

Simulation studies were performed on the two proposed center hub designs, one based on a Dodecagon polygon and the other an oblong shape with more surface area in one direction.

SOLIDWORKS (SW) files are included in this Repo for each design and within each zip file are a set of simulations results which can be viewed from within the SW application.
