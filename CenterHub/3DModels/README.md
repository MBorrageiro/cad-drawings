This section contains different ideas for the construction of the Center Hub. 
The different designs do not necessarily relate to each other and related designs are represented under single headings below.

## Cake Tin v1
This was a possible approach to creating the center hub cavity to house autopilot parts and on board computer.

**Design Details:**
- The designs is tailored for sheet metal but can be reworked to work with other material types.
- A lid would be included to seal the center hub.
- The seams of the design would need to be sealed in a suitable way depending on the material.

**Files:**
- CakeTinV1.SLDPRT: editable solid works(SW) file.

## Modular Chassis Unit (MCU)
A modualr chassis unit to act in a way similar to a chassis of a car. 
This will connect all rotor arms together as well as landing gear and provide a frame for the center hub and other periphery sensors can be attached to.

**Design Details:**
- Chassis clamp, these will attach the rotor arms to the chassis plate.
- Chassis plate, a method to connect all the clamps together and provide a plateform to connect the center hub. This plate can have any shapre or design.
- Currently investigating the use of materials ther than aluminium.

**Files:**
- ChassisPlateHex.SLDPRT: editable SW file of chassis plate, hexagon arrangement.
- ChassisClamp.SLDPRT: editable SW file of chassis clamp to attach rotor arms to plate, possible to replace with U-channel.
- ChassisClampHex.SLDASM: editable SW assembly file of the 6 clamps and hexagon plate.
