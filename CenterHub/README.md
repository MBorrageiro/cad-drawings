This file contains the work flow and development of the center hub design.

## 3D Models
[This file](https://github.com/MBorrageiro/cad-drawings/tree/main/CenterHub/3DModels) contains some 3D representations on possible approaches to creating and house the center hub.

## MCUDesign
The Modular Chassis Unit makes use of a single set of plates that can be reonfigured to switch the drone configuration between a hexacopter and quadcopter without any additionals cuts or features on the center hub plates.

The MCU Designs and Verisons can be found [here](https://github.com/MBorrageiro/cad-drawings/tree/main/CenterHub/MCUDesigns)
