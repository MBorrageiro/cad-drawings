# GPS Mounting
The GPs mount is still under development, however this folder contains the current experimental mounting options.

## All in One Mount (_Current Prototype (01/06/2022)_)
_This is the current prototype being used on both the Quad and Hex configuration of the multirotor._

This revision combined the rail mount and base plate into one single 3D print. Previously, these two components were seperate for ease of printing however,
 they were connected by a steel bolt. This was causing interference with the compass.
 
 There are two revisions of the Ai1HereGPSMount:
 - Ai1HereGpsMount (_Current Prototype (01/06/2022)_)
 - Ai1HereGpsMountLong
 
 The difference is a longer stem, increase the height of the GPS from the center hub.

## GPS Rail Mount
The GPS rail mount is still being used to connect the GPS to the top rails, it has simple been incorporated into a single 3D printed part in the Ai1HereGpsMount.

## HERE GPS
This was an attempt to create a snap-fit joint to hold he GPS in place. This is designed to work with the HERE GPS units, howevere requries some revision
and improvement to work as intended.

## _Development Note:_
We are currently experiencing compass interference, believed to be from the current draw of the motors. Thus this may lead to drastic change and 
repositioning of the GPS mount.
