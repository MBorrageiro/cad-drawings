# Quick Release Clamp Ideas

## Improvements:

### Design:
- More space for fastener
- Larger, quite small to work with, can fumble working with it.
- Thicker than 8mm. maybe make it quite a bit larger.
- Top rails might be better if the rails are larger.

### 3D printing:
- Use supports inbetween pin slots.
