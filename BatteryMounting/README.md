# Battery Mounting
This repositorty contains possible ways to connect the battery to the drone center hub.

Included in this folder are Gimbal attachment methods. These gimbal methods are present as they directly rely on the battery mounting to operate correctly.

## Battery Plate with Butterfly Nut (*Accepted Design (03/27/2022)*)
[This folder](https://github.com/MBorrageiro/cad-drawings/tree/main/BatteryMounting/BatPlateButFlyNut) contains battery plate along with some visual representation STL files.

The contents of the fodler:

**BatPlateButFlyNut.SLDPRT**:
- SOLIDWORKS  3D editable part file of the battery mounting plate secured with butterfly nuts.

**BatPlateButFlyNut.DXF**:
- CNC Cutting/Routing file for the battery plate.
- The material used in the prototype was Carbon Fiber Twill Weave, 3mm thickness.

There are two additionals files in the above folder, `.STL` and `.SLDASM`. These files are simply for visual representation however they are outdated and will be fixed to showcase the parts in the `.DXF` and `.SLDPRT` files.

## GimbalMounts
*This folder is under development and will be updated soon with the accepted designs*

## Simple Battery Model (*For Display*)
This folder contains a SOLIDWORKS part to simulate a battery and is intended for sizing in 3D renders.
