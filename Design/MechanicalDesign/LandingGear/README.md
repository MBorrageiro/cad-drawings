This design makes use of simple tripod design for the landing gear. This steers away from the common 'T-Shaped' landing gear that has become synonymous with sUAS.
The Design is comprised of a carbon fiber tube which connects to the [Rotor Boom Mounts](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/LANDRs-Science-Drone/tree/main/Design/MechanicalDesign/RotorBoomMounts) and has a simple rounded end that comes into contact 
with the floor. This is part is known as a [Landing Gear Tube Cap](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/LANDRs-Science-Drone/tree/main/Design/MechanicalDesign/LandingGear/SimpleTripod) and is 3D printed.
