# Radio Receiver Mounts
This folder contains mounting designs for the radio controller (R/C) and the telemetry recievers. These mounts are not strickly necessary and can be replaced with 3M or other adhessive options, however this is not recommended.

## RC Reciever:

The R/C designs are specificly for the FrSky ARCHER GR8 Receiver.
There are two designs inlcuded, where the antenna are oriented 90&deg; apart, just in two different planes.

**90VP:**

The antenna are 90&deg; apart in the vertical plane(VP). One runs vertically and the other horizontally.

**90HP:**

This differs to the VP in that both antenna are in the horizotnal plane(HP), yet still 90&deg; apart.

## Telemetry Radios.

The HexaQuad has two options for telemetry links, one makes use of RFD900 radios and the second, is based on a mobile network. The telemetry links are the main connection between the HexaQuad and the ground control station(GCS). The suggested mounting options are listed below:

### RFD900 Mounts:
There are two differnet 3D printable cases, one that allows mounting of the receiver on the HexaQuad and another that serves as a protective case of the transmitter that connects to the GCS.

**Telemetry Case for HexaQuad:**

A simple snap fit case to protect the RFD telemetry radio and provide a mounting point to secure the radio to the HexaQuad. This snap fit makes use of the following [carbon fiber tube mount]()
