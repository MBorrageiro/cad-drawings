# Sensor Mounts and Related Items
*Under development...*

This folder contains parts to assist with mounting sensors to the HexaQuad. It also provides solutions for mounting items associated with sensors such as Type-C USB sockets for powering devices.

## Type-C Socket Mounts:
Some suggested and tested mounting strategies for USB Type-C sockets for powering devices. [Type-C Mounts](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/LANDRs-Science-Drone/tree/main/Design/MechanicalDesign/SensorMounts/C-TypeSocketMounts)

## Nut Insert (Ni) Tube Mounting:
A simple mount that fits onto any 25mm diameter carbon tube of the HexaQuad. This is used for mounting the RFD telemetry radios and R/C receiver. [Ni-Tube Mount](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/LANDRs-Science-Drone/tree/main/Design/MechanicalDesign/SensorMounts/NiTubeMounting)

## Nut Insert (Ni) Rail Mounting:
A simple mount to aid connection to the gimbal rails. This part has a 12mm diameter and can be used on either the top or bot gimbal rail. [Ni-Rail Mount](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/LANDRs-Science-Drone/tree/main/Design/MechanicalDesign/SensorMounts/NutInsertRailMounting)

## Rail Snap On Mounts:
A horrizontal bar that 'snap-locks' onto the parallel 12mm gimbal rails. There are two lengths available due to different spacings of the top and bot gimbal rails. [SnO Mounts](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/LANDRs-Science-Drone/tree/main/Design/MechanicalDesign/SensorMounts/RailSnapMount)

## Rail Mounting Blanks:
This folder contains blank models of the GPS rail mount and gimbal rail mounts. These blanks can be merged with custom sensor mounts to connect them to the HexaQuad.
