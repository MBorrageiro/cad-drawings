This folder contains a standard part that assists in mounting peripherals to the HexaQuad on either the landing gear legs or rotorbooms. It is a simple loop that slips onto any of the 25mm diameter carbon fiber tubes and is secured by a friction fit when the mounting screw is tightened.

This part requires an **M3 standard nut** to be embedded for the intended operation. See this tutorials for assistance on inserting nuts into prints, [here](https://www.landrs.org/LANDRs-Science-Drone/GettingStarted/Tutorials/3DPrintInserts.html).
