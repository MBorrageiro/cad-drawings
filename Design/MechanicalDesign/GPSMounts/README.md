# GPS Mounting
This folder contians the development of the GPS mount. Two version were tested, a short and long option. The short mount is currently in use.


## All in One Mount
_This is the current prototype being used on both the Quad and Hex configuration of the multirotor._

This revision combined the rail mount and base plate into one single 3D print. Previously, these two components were seperate for ease of printing however,
 they were connected by a steel bolt. This was causing interference with the compass.
 
 There are two revisions of the Ai1HereGPSMount:
 - Ai1HereGpsMount (_Current Prototype (06/01/2022)_)
   - [STL File](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/LANDRs-Science-Drone/blob/main/MechanicalDesign/GPSMounts/Ai1HEREGpsMount.STL), [SOLIDWORKS Part](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/LANDRs-Science-Drone/blob/main/MechanicalDesign/GPSMounts/Ai1HEREGpsMount.SLDASM)
 - Ai1HereGpsMountLong
   - [STL File](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/LANDRs-Science-Drone/blob/main/MechanicalDesign/GPSMounts/Ai1HEREGpsMountLong.STL), [SOLIDWORKS Part](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/LANDRs-Science-Drone/blob/main/MechanicalDesign/GPSMounts/Ai1HEREGpsMountLong.SLDASM)
 
 The difference is a longer stem on the _long_ version to increase the height of the GPS from the center hub.

# Blank Designs for Customisation

## GPS Rail Mount
The GPS rail mount is still being used to connect the GPS to the top rails, it has simply been incorporated into a single 3D printed part in the Ai1HereGpsMount.

## HERE GPS
This was an attempt to create a snap-fit joint to hold he GPS in place. This is designed to work with the HERE GPS units, howevere requries some revision
and improvement to work as intended.
