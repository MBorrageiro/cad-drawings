The PDB mount is designed for the [Matek PDB-HEX, 12S](https://www.mateksys.com/?portfolio=pdb-hex) board. The simple mount is to secure the PDB and provide some electrical isolation of the PCB from the carbon fiber center plate. 

The design mirrors the shape of the PCB and has embedded nuts to secure the PDB to the mount. The PDB is currently secured to the center hub with industrial velcro.
