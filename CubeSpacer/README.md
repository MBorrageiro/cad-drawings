# Cube Spacers
These CAD drawings are simple designs to attach the standard Cubepilot carrier board to a Tarot 680 Pro drone frame.

## CubeSpacerV1

This simple design accommodates the carrier board by using exisiting holes on the frame. It acts as a spacer to provide room to fit M2.5 screws into the holes.
