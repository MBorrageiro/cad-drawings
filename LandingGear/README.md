# Landing Gear Designs for the Science Drone

## Carbon Fiber Tube Leg (*Currently Under Development*)
- *Version 1*: Simple attachment of the leg to the rotor boom.
- *Version 2*: Replace the need for rotor boom mounts and then the additional leg mount, such that they become one mount.
- *Version 3.0*: Redesigned the way mount clamps around the CF tube. Instead of a left and right, there is now a top and bottom. This reduces the number of screws.
- *Version 3.1*: Slight adjustment of design, moved holes near the front of the mount out a little to avoid cut-out areas on the bottom plate.
