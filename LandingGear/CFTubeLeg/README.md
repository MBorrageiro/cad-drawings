# CFT Leg Landing Gear

This folder contains the current working of the Carbon Fiber Tube Leg. All the associated components to make up the assembley are present:
- Mount 1(Left/Top)
- Mount 2(Right/Bot)
- Leg Rounding Cap
- Carbon Fiber Tube (25mm)

## Leg Mount Only, *V1*:

This design of the leg mount was simply to allow the landing gear to attach to the rotor booms of the drone.
The mount clamps onto the rotor boom and allos the addition of a landing gear leg.
The landing gear mount can be placed anywhere along the rotor boom and tightend to be secured in place.

## Leg and Rotor Mount, *V2*:

Version 2 sees a change to the design to perform the function of mounting the rotor booms to the center hub and housing the landing gear legs.
The mount will be "sandwiched" between two center plates for additional strength.
An alternative mount will be created such that not all the rotor mounts come with a leg mount, i.e. it will only accomodate a rotor mount.

## Top and Bottom Mounting Clamp, *V3*:

This is a further iteration of **Version 2** and adjusts the manner in which the mount clamps to the rotor boom.
This change was created to facilitate possible ease of mounting and dismounting the landing gear leg or rotor boom as it would not require the entire 
centeral hub to be disassembled.

## Additionals Files:

There are three additional files provided to create a SOLIDWORKS assembly file:
- LGTubeAsm: The assembly file containing the two mounts and the following two parts.
- LGTubeCap: A 3D printable round "Cap" for the carbon fuber tube to act as a foot
- LGTubeCF: A simple hollow carbon fiber tube, (OD25mm,ID23mm,L350mm).
- LGTubeTBMV3Asm: This is the assembly containing the parts with in the *version 3* folder.
