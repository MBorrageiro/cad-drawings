# CFT Leg Landing Gear

This folder contains the current working of the Carbon Fiber Tube Leg. All the associated components to make up the assembley are present:
- Mount 1(Left/Top), _3D Printed Part_
- Mount 2(Right/Bot), _3D Printed Part_
- Leg Rounding Cap, _3D Printed Part_
- Carbon Fiber Tube (25mm Outer Diameter)

## Leg Mount Only, *V1*:

This design of the leg mount was simply to allow the landing gear to attach to the rotor booms of the drone.
The mount clamps onto the rotor boom and allos the addition of a landing gear leg.
The landing gear mount can be placed anywhere along the rotor boom and tightend to be secured in place.

## Leg and Rotor Mount, *V2*:

Version 2 sees a change to the design to perform the function of mounting the rotor booms to the center hub and housing the landing gear legs.
The mount will be "sandwiched" between two center plates for additional strength.
An alternative mount will be created such that not all the rotor mounts come with a leg mount, i.e. it will only accomodate a rotor mount.

## Top and Bottom Mounting Clamp, *V3*:

This is a design revision of **Version 2** and adjusts the manner in which the mount clamps to the rotor boom.
This change was created to facilitate possible ease of mounting and dismounting the landing gear leg or rotor boom as it would not require the entire 
centeral hub to be disassembled. The clamping mechanise is now comprise of a top and bottom instead of a left and right components.

## Top and Bottom Mounting Clamp, *V3.1*:

**Version 3.1** introduces a small change to accommodate screws located near the front of the design. In the **Version 3.0**, the front mount hole paths collided with a cutout area of the bottom center hub plate and compromised the fastening area. Revision: front mount holes spaced further apart to provide clearance of the bottom center hub cutout and sufficient area to fasten the screws.

## Additionals Files:

There are three additional files provided to create a SOLIDWORKS assembly file:
- LGTubeAsm: The assembly file containing the two mounts and the following two parts.
- LGTubeCap: A 3D printable round "Cap" for the carbon fuber tube to act as a foot
- LGTubeCF: A simple hollow carbon fiber tube, (OD25mm,ID23mm,L350mm).
- LGTubeTBMV3Asm: This is the assembly containing the parts with in the *version 3* folder.
- RotorMountOnlyAsm: The alternative, in the case only a rotor arm needs to be mounted to the center hub.
