## Version 1

This design of the leg mount was simply to allow the landing gear to attache the rotor booms of the drone.
The mount clamps onto the rotor boom and allos the addition of a landing gear leg.

## Version 2:

Version 2 sees a change to the design to perform the function of mounting the rotor booms to the center hub and housing the landing gear legs.
