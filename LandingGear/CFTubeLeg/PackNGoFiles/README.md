# Pack and Go files
Solidworks provides us with a feature to "pack and go" assemblies. This simply means all relavent components are collected into a single `.zip` file and 
the user doesn't have to collect individual files manually for an assembly to work.

**Files**
- LGTubeASm: 
    <br>Landing gear with Rotor Boom and Motor Mount
- RotorMountOnlyASm: 
    <br>Only the Rotor Boom, Mount and Motor Mount
