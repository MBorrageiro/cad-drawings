# Getting Flying with your HexaQuad
A tricky part about building and designing your own sUAS is making sure it is stable and predictable in flight. Beyond ensuring your HexaQuad is constructed correctly we need to ensure it tuned correctly to achieve stablility in flight.

We have been through these steps already and have completed the [tuning guide](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-tuning.html) according to the Ardupilot documentation. You simply need to upload either the Hex or Quad parameter files to you CubePilot for your respective configuration of the HexaQuad.
