Welcome to the primary source for all the design materials and users guides for the LANDRS Nyala HexaQuad.


The HexaQuad is an open source, modular multirotor designed with stringent academic research data provenance in mind.
It is a simple to replicate and user friendly design for drone novices and experts alike, all you need are some basic tools, 3D printer and access to CNC routing.

**Status:**
* Drone is undergoing performance testing, see provisional flight performance [here](https://youtu.be/huQ6nF6V_Ks)
* This repo contains CAD files for the Nyala HexaQuad, associate documentation and ardupilot parameter files
* This repo intends to release version 1 before the end of 2022


## Documentation

## Presentation at Linux Open Source Summit Europe 2022
We were invited to present our work at the Linux Open Source Summit that took place in Dublin, 2022. The Linux foundation flew us out to present our work to the open source community.

The full presentation given at the summit can be found on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/drAO9xs3WeU).
