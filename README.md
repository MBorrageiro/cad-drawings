**Welcome to the primary source for all the design materials and users guides for the LANDRS Nyala HexaQuad.**


The HexaQuad is an open source, modular multirotor designed with stringent academic research data provenance in mind.
It is a simple to replicate, user friendly design for drone novices and experts alike, all you need are some basic tools, a 3D printer and once off access to CNC routing.

**Specifications:**
* 15-20 minutes operation time with 1-3kg payload
* Configured as Hex or Quad
* Max flight time: 30 - 35 minutes (16.8Ah)
* Max Payload: 2kg(Quad); 5kg(Hex)
* Battery Voltage: 6S

A short description of the HexaQuad can be found on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/huQ6nF6V_Ks) and detailed specifications can be seen below.

## Documentation

## Presentation at Linux Open Source Summit Europe 2022
We were invited to present our work at the Linux Open Source Summit that took place in Dublin, 2022. The Linux foundation flew us out to present our work to the open source community.

The full presentation given at the summit can be found on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/drAO9xs3WeU).

In the presentation we explore the motivation for the HexaQuad and how it can benefit researchers compared to drones available off the shelf. There is further exploration of the design considerations and performance.
