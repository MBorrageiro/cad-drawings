* This repo contains CAD files for the Nyala HexaQuad, associate documentation and ardupilot parameter files
* This repo intends to release version 1 before the end of 2022


## Documentation

The documentation can be found at [https://www.landrs.org/LANDRs-Science-Drone/](https://www.landrs.org/LANDRs-Science-Drone/). This will house the build instructions, assistance guides and all information relating to the HexaQuad.

## Presentation at Linux Open Source Summit Europe 2022
We were invited to present our work at the Linux Open Source Summit that took place in Dublin, 2022. The Linux foundation flew us out to present our work to the open source community.

The full presentation given at the summit can be found on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/drAO9xs3WeU).

In the presentation we explore the motivation for the HexaQuad and how it can benefit researchers compared to drones available off the shelf. There is further exploration of the design considerations and performance.
