# Aluminium S-Bend Leg
This folder contains three versions of a possible aluminium leg design for the MSc Science Drone.

***

## There are three versions:<br>
v1:
* Small bend radius, 1mm
* Thickness of 3.18mm

![AluLegV1](https://github.com/MBorrageiro/cad-drawings/blob/main/AluminiumLeg/AlulegV1.PNG =250x250)

v2: 
* Increased bend radius, 50mm
* Thickness varied, 3.18-4.78mm

![AluLegV2](https://github.com/MBorrageiro/cad-drawings/blob/main/AluminiumLeg/AlulegV2.PNG =250x250)

v3:
* Small bend radius, 1mm
* Thickness of 4.78mm
* Cut outs to reduce weight

***
## Included, is a Mechanical analysis of 'v1' and 'v2'.
There are three tests in the files due to set fixtures and applied loads:
1. von Mises Stress
2. Deformation (Displacement) 
3. Safety factor

The tests were complete for a set aluminium alloy.
