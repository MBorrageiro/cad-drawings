**v3**:
* Small bend radius, 1mm
* Thickness of 4.78mm
* Cut outs to reduce weight

***
## Included, is a Mechanical analysis of 'v1' and 'v2'.
There are three tests in the files due to set fixtures and applied loads:
1. von Mises Stress
2. Deformation (Displacement) 
3. Safety factor

The tests were complete for a set aluminium alloy.
