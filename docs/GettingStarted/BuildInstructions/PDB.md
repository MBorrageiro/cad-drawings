# Power Distribution
{: .no_toc }
This section will outline the connections of all the power carrying lines in the HexaQuad. It will detail motor connections, current sensor mounting, battery connections and periphery power connections for sensors and the autopilot. All connections will be related to the power distribution board (PDB).
