# Assembly of the HexaQuad
{: .no_toc }
This section will illustrate how to assemble the HexaQuad using the Hex configuration as an example, any differences with the Quad configuration will be highlighted when necessary.
These instructions are going to use all the previous assemblies constructed in the previous steps

- Socket set to tighten the nuts

## Assembling the HexaQuad
These instructions make use of the Hex configuration as an example however the Quad assembly is very similar and an variations will be identified.

Before assembly begins, make sure to identify the correct mounting holes for the desired configuration.
The landing gear, rotorboom and battery plate mounting holes for the Hex and Quad configurations are highlighted below:

The circles in the figure above indicate rotorboom and landing gear mounting locations.
The *blue circles* are for the *Quad* and the **red circles** are for the **Hex**.
Guidance on choosing the best Hex landing gear locations will be highlighted below. The Quad configuration requires landing gear at all the rotorboom locations.

### Step 1, *Mounting the landing gear to the bottom plate*
