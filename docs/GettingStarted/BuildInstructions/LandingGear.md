# Landing Gear
{: .no_toc }
We start our assembly with the landing gear. These are simple structures and can be assembled almost completely before being added to the rest of the frame. The landing gear of the HexaQuad is extremely simple and was designed as such to be easy to replace and avoid breaking in the case of a crash.
